This is what Goyo does:
	+ Toggle status line:
		+,i set laststatus=0 showtabline=0
			hide the status line
		+,i set laststatus=2 showtabline=2
			show statusline
	+ Toggle ruler
		+,i set ruler
			show ruler
		+
	+ Change window
		+,i 
			set winminheight=1
			set winheight=1
			set winminwidth=1 winwidth=1
			set laststatus=0
			set showtabline=0
			set noruler
			set fillchars+=vert:\ 
			set fillchars+=stl:\ 
			set fillchars+=stlnc:\ 

	+ Hide left hand scroll bars if any on GUI
		+,i
			if has('gui_running')
				set guioptions-=l
				set guioptions-=L
			endif


how centering text works:
	1. create two splits on the sides (https://superuser.com/questions/537584/in-vim-how-to-move-text-to-be-edited-to-the-middle-of-the-window)
		You could have empty windows on the left and right of the one you're editing:
			:leftabove vnew			for creating split in the left
			:wincmd l				move to split in the left
			:vnew					for creating split in the right
			:wincmd h				for moving to the split in the left (center)
		
		remember that before moving to other splits run the following command and also execute TZMinimalist
			:setlocal buftype=nofile bufhidden=wipe nomodifiable nobuflisted noswapfile nocursorline nocursorcolumn

		for every buffer on each side do:
			1. create it `:leftabove vnew			for creating split in the left`
			3. set size width `:vertical resize 60`
			4. disable all external stuff `:setlocal buftype=nofile bufhidden=wipe nomodifiable nobuflisted noswapfile nocursorline nocursorcolumn nonumber norelativenumber noruler noshowmode noshowcmd laststatus=0`


	2. resize those splits (:vertical resize <num>) https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/514/how-do-i-change-the-current-splits-width-and-height/518
	3. prevent window from resizing `:set noequalalways`
	4. hide border chars with (based on goyo)
		set fillchars+=vert:\ 
		set fillchars+=stl:\ 
		set fillchars+=stlnc:\ 
	5. execute minimalist mode on all of the splits
	6. avoid buffers from being modifiable (https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim/blob/master/autoload/goyo.vim#L51)
	7. `:vertical resize 80` will set your current vsplit to 80 characters wide
	8. after untoggled quit all buffers


after left and right splits are set, check if bottom split setting = 0, if so, do nothing, else create split on top with that margin set:
	1. leftabove new.
	2. resize #
	2. do settings stuff
	3. :wincmd j to return to main screen



IMPORTANT:

how to hide statusline for onces and for all:
	:set statusline=-        " hide file name in statusline
	Hide its colors if any after being removed:
		:highlight StatusLine ctermfg=bg ctermbg=bg guibg=bg guifg=bg 
hide horizontal fillchars:
	:highlight StatusLineNC ctermfg=bg ctermbg=bg guibg=bg guifg=bg


refer to this thread: https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/14217/how-to-hide-horizontal-line-between-windows

		


if I want to make add a do_it_for_me_setting for the paddings, in order of exection I'll have to:

	0. check if mode is enabled
	1. get current window width
	2. get current window height
	3. vertical resize #

For the zoom (focus?) mode:

Focus the window:
	1. vert resize | resize
	2. normal! ze

Unfocus the window:
	1. wincmd =
	2. normal! ze
